# UI Architecture for 10xCards

## 1. UI Structure Overview
The 10xCards UI is structured to offer an intuitive, minimal, and responsive experience that accommodates both manual and AI-driven flashcard creation. The interface relies on a dashboard layout with a fixed sidebar navigation that clearly separates core functionalities (manual flashcards, AI-generated flashcards, and account settings). Each view is designed to provide immediate feedback and enforce input validations.

## 3. User Journey Map
1. **Entry Point:** The user starts with the authentication views (registration or login).

   - Initiate an AI flashcard generation process by submitting text.
   - Click on any flashcard in the dashboard to view details and edit the flashcard.
4. **AI Generation Process:** When using AI generation, the user submits long text, sees a loading spinner, and eventually views the generated flashcards with options to accept, edit, or reject.
5. **Account Management:** At any point, the user can access the Account Settings to update personal details or review security settings.

## 4. Layout and Navigation Structure
