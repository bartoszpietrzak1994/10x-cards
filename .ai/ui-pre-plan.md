1. The main dashboard will have a sidebar navigation (instead of a header) that separates navigation for manual flashcards, AI-generated flashcards, and user account settings.  
2. The view hierarchy will mirror the API endpoints with distinct screens for flashcards listing, flashcard details, and flashcard creation/editing.  
3. The onboarding flow will only cover authentication (registration/login) without additional initial setup guidance.  
4. AI flashcard generation will have dedicated, responsive components with real-time status updates (processing, completed, failed).  
5. Flashcard creation and editing interfaces will enforce character limits and input validations per product requirements.  
6. A robust application state management strategy will be used to synchronize and reflect API responses dynamically across views.  
7. Error handling in the UI will utilize a consistent top alert box with color-coded (green, yellow, red) and icon-based messages, while keeping it simple in scope.  
8. Caching strategies are not required in the MVP scope.  
9. The UI will enforce accessibility standards by ensuring keyboard navigability and proper ARIA attributes.  
10. Existing UI libraries (Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui) will be leveraged to build a responsive and consistent interface.  
11. The sidebar will include collapsible menu sections with distinct icons.  
12. The design will support both dark and light themes.  
13. User profile information (profile picture and username) will be prominently displayed within the sidebar.  
14. During synchronous API operations, a spinner overlay will be shown; all interactive elements will be disabled.  
15. Inline feedback for form errors (including authentication forms) will be provided.  
16. Success and error alerts will include icons and support auto-dismiss after a set time.  
17. Sorting and filtering for flashcards listings, as well as additional account settings, are skipped in the MVP scope.  
18. Additional keyboard shortcuts or split views for flashcard editing are skipped for the MVP.  
19. The flashcard detail view will navigate to a dedicated editing screen for modifications.  
20. A minimalist, card-based dashboard layout will be used to surface core actions without unnecessary complexity.

<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
The conversation established clear UI architecture priorities for the MVP. The primary dashboard will feature a sidebar navigation system that cleanly separates manual flashcards, AI-generated flashcards, and user account settings, all presented in a minimalist, card-based layout. The view hierarchy is designed to mirror API endpoints, offering dedicated screens for listing flashcards, viewing flashcard details, and editing or creating flashcards. Authentication is limited to the essential registration and login processes, with inline validation providing immediate user feedback on input errors.

Real-time feedback is a priority, with dedicated UI components for AI flashcard generation that include status indicators (e.g., spinners for synchronous operations, color-coded alert boxes with icons for backend responses). The alert system is designed to consistently appear at the top of the screen, dynamically resizing for multi-line messages and auto-dismissing after a set period for clarity. State management is planned to be robust enough to handle dynamic data synchronization without additional caching complexity.

Accessibility is upheld by requiring keyboard navigability, proper ARIA attributes, support for both dark and light themes, and prominent user profile display within the sidebar. Security measures in the UI include transforming API error messages into user-friendly alerts, thus preventing exposure of technical details while providing clear error communication.

The development will leverage existing UI tools such as Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui, streamlining the building process and ensuring design consistency. Some advanced features, like keyboard shortcuts, split views for flashcard editing, additional help/tooltips for non-critical actions, and sorting/filtering capabilities for flashcards, have been deliberately excluded in the MVP scope to maintain focus on core functionality.
